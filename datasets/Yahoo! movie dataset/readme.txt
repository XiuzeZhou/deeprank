ydata-ymovies-mapping-to-movielens-v1_0.txt

each based on data generated by Yahoo! Movies on or before November

The content of the six files are as follows:

=====================================================================
(1) "ydata-ymovies-user-movie-ratings-train-v1_0.txt" contains a small
    sample of Yahoo! users' ratings of movies, with the following
    fields:

    0 anonymized user_id
    1 movie_id
    2 rating(from 1(F) to 13(A+))
    3 converted rating(from 1 to 5: A-,A, A+ will be converted to 5)

    The training data contains 7,642 users (|U|), 11,915 movies/items
    (|I|), and 211,231 ratings (|R|). The average user rating
    ($\overline{R_u} = \frac{\sum_u \overline{r_u}}{|U|}$,
    macro-averaged) is 9.64 and the average item rating
    (macro-averaged) is 9.32. The average number of ratings per user
    is 27.64 and the average number of ratings per item is 17.73. All
    users have rated at least 10 items and all items are rated by at
    least one user. The density ratio (\delta = \frac{|R|}{|U|*|I|})
    is 0.0023, meaning that only 0.23% of entries in the user-item
    matrix are filled.
